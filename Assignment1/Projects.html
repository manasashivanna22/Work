<h1> Bachelor's Degree Project </h1>

<p> <h3>  “Reflection of Multiple objects in mirror” </h3> </p>
<h4> Jan 2014 - Apr 2014 </h4>

<p> Mini Project on “Reflection of Multiple objects in mirror” using glut library in visual studio software. The objects used to display on mirror are the regular polygons, constructed using inbuilt functions which are able to move with the user interaction by drag function. The mirror is incorporated using the stencil function which reflects the object with reference to the angle of reflection in front of it. </p>

<p> <h3> “Incremental Affinity propagation Clustering based on message passing" </h3> </p>
<h4> July 2014 – Dec 2014 </h4>

<p> The Project aims at obtaining object examplers together with a high precision for the data associated with it and perform recognition using a majority voting strategy that is weighted by nearest neighbor similarity. The two incremental clustering methods K-Medoids and nearest neighbor assignment (IAPKM) are applied on the real time data sets. Experimental results show that IAPKM can achieve comparable clustering performance with traditional AP methods. </p>
  
<p> <h3> “Anomaly Detection via online oversampling principal component analysis” </h3> </p>
 <h4> Jan 2015- June 2015 </h4>

 <p> 
A project on combined concepts of Networks and Data mining titled “Anomaly Detection via online oversampling principal component analysis”. The Project aims at determining the contaminated data and removing it based on few rules. In this project, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis algorithm and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior PCA based approaches we do not store entire covariance matrix. The project is favored for the online applications, which has computation or memory limitations. </p>
