<h1> Master's Degree Project </h1>

 <p> <h3> “Sorting algorithms” </h3> </p>
  <h4> Feb 2016 </h4>
  <img src="sorting.jpg" width="160" height="154" />
  <p> The project aims at explaining the performance comparison between the three different sorting algorithms by considering three scenarios as sorting the randomly generated elements, sorting the ordered elements and sorting the reverse ordered elements accordingly. The comparison is done based on the processing time taken by each algorithm to sort the elements for the defined scenarios and chose the best sorting algorithm based on the number of elements given as input.
The three sorting algorithms used in thus project are: Selection sort, Insertion sort and Bubble sort </p>

<p> <h3> “Analysis and documentation on database requirements for E-commerce company ShoppingBag.com </h3> </p>
<h4>  Feb 2016 – May 2016 </h4>

<p> ShoppingBag.com™ is an E-commerce online market, through which customers can customize their own product choice based on their requirement such as colors, materials used, texture of the product etc.. The specific technical requirements for the company are determined and its necessity for the database after the merger with the multinational company is documented. The relation between each of the requirements are categorized and explained with entity-relation diagrams. The functionalities of the company are explained through the data flow diagrams and basic operations of database such as normalizations which are performed on the database of the company are documented </p>

<p> <h3> “Crowdsourcing based Spatial Mining of Urban Emergency Events using Social Media” </h3> </p>
<h4> Aug 2016 – Dec 2016 </h4> 
<img src="crowdsourcing.jpg" width="160" height="154" />
<p> With the advances of information communication technologies, it is critical to improve the efficiency and accuracy of emergency management systems through modern data processing techniques. Identifying the actual data among the altered data is difficult, since the existence of large data from many users make difficult to find the original source and information of the data. a crowdsourcing based model for mining spatial information of urban emergency events is introduced. Firstly, basic definitions of the proposed method are given. Secondly, positive samples are selected to mine the spatial information of urban emergency events. Thirdly, location and GIS information are extracted from positive samples. At last, the real spatial information is determined based on address and GIS information and recorded. </p>
